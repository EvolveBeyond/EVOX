# Supporting Evox Development

Thank you for your interest in supporting the Evox framework! Your contributions help ensure the project's continued development, maintenance, and improvement.

## Why Donate?

Evox is an open-source project developed and maintained by volunteers. While the framework is free to use for everyone under the permissive MIT License, ongoing development requires time, effort, and sometimes financial resources for infrastructure, tools, and community support.

Your support helps us:
- Maintain and improve the core framework
- Develop new features and enhancements
- Fix bugs and security issues promptly
- Create documentation and learning resources
- Build a vibrant community around the project

- GitHub Sponsors organization for Evox
