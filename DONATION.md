# Supporting Evox Development

## Why Donate?

Evox is an open-source project developed and maintained by volunteers. While the framework is free to use for everyone under the permissive Apache License 2.0, ongoing development requires time, effort, and sometimes financial resources for infrastructure, tools, and community support.

Your support helps us:
- Maintain and improve the core framework
- Develop new features and enhancements
- Fix bugs and security issues promptly
- Create documentation and learning resources
- Build a vibrant community around the project
